This report is generated after ***CROCKETA*** (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.16.654451) execution as single-cell sequencing multiomic pipeline of analysis.
This report contains information extracted from QC (Quality Control) at both sequence & single-cell levels, and normalization steps.

This single-cell RNA-seq analysis was perform from **{{ snakemake.config["input_type"] }}** files, using **{{ snakemake.config["technology"] }}** technology.

Output and log files can be found in:

- **Output files**: {{ snakemake.config["outdir"] }}
